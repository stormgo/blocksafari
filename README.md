blocksafari
===========

blocksafari is a web-based frontend to the blockchain in [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd).

**blocksafari is proof-of-concept code from our early work with
  btcd.**

**This code is not suitable for production use and requires major
  refactoring and rewriting to bring it up to speed with current
  proper usage of btcsuite packages and conventions.**
